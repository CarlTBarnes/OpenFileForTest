# OpenFileForTest 

Test your File code (Open, Copy, Remove) handles errors correctly when a program has a
 file locked or opened in an Access or Share mode not compatible with the mode your
 code requests. You can also use this tool to test when your program has a file open
 what modes can be used to open and read the file.
